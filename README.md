# ChromeHacking
ChromeHacking (chrome.py) reads and writes binary information found in Google Chrome's database to harvest saved passwords, and written those into a .txt format. # This was made with Python 3.7.5 (Windows)
# Note
  • This works on all Python versions.

# Who made this?
* parad0x (front-end developer)
* snavellet (back-end developer[APIs]) 

# Some Cool Features
  - Write saved passwords into a .txt file
  - Use smtplib to send that file to an email address
  - Write & Delete saved information (newly created .txt file)
# Updates
    • Added Windows(only) support. (More will be added as script progresses)
    • Removes all console recognition by user. (You can modify the script to your expertise)
    
# Reminders
    • Remember to replace '' string to YOUR details. (this will prevent any runtime errors)
    • If you would like to modify this software, please FORK it. :)    
    
# Ideas
    • Make chrome.py a library on pypi(pip)
    • Make it fully user accessible.
