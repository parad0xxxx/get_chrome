# REMINDER
## USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Operating systems besides Windows were not intended to function with this script, but we have progressively made commitments to achieve this.

## Installation
* Either use pyinstaller to convert it into an .exe file. (example) - 
// ```pyinstaller scriptname.py --onefile```
* // Or you can run it in python shell (or cmd/terminal)

## Contributing
```Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.```

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
